 * Creating a sidebar enables you to:
 - create an ordered group of docs
 - render a sidebar for each doc of that group
 - provide next/previous navigation

 The sidebars can be generated from the filesystem, or explicitly defined here.

 Create as many sidebars as you want.

// ## Basic Example

// The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.
// The only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.
// To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.

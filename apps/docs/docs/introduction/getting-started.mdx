> 🤯 Simplest and reactive state manager for React _`(just 1.7kb)`_

Cervello is a reactive, tiny and fast state-management library for React

It's **`as easy as reassign a new value`** to the store properties. <br/>It will make an immutable change to the store and notify all the components subscribed
to that property or the entire store.

<!-- Cervello v5 is in beta, and it's not recommended for production yet. <br/> -->
<!-- For stable (latest) version docs, go to [Legacy version docs](/docs/legacy-version-docs/api-reference/store) <br/> -->

<!-- Focused on performance, simplicity and flexibility. -->

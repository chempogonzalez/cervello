> 🤯 Simplest and reactive state manager for React _`(just 1.5kb)`_

Cervello is a reactive, tiny and fast state-management library for React

It's **as easy as reassign a new value** to the store properties. <br/>It will make an immutable change to the store and notify all the components subscribed
to that property or the entire store.

<!-- :::info v2 Breaking Changes -->
<!-- From v2.0.0, Cervello has 0 dependencies and it drops the React 17 compatibility. Now, React 18 is mandatory. -->
<!---->
<!-- _If you still need to use Cervello with React 17, you can keep using the v1.2.1 which is the latest stable version._ -->
<!-- ::: -->
